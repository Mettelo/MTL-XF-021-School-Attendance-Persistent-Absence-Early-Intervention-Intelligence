# MTL-XF-021 — Reference data and mappings

## Purpose

Maintain the code lists and crosswalks needed to implement this analytical grain:

Geographic fact: reporting period × period coverage × geography level/code × school phase × other published breakdowns. Characteristics fact: period × available geography × phase × characteristic type/value. Keep the two facts separate unless their dimensional coverage supports an explicit join.

Potential references are the publisher's geography/entity identifiers, category hierarchies, period definitions, units, status codes and revision markers. Include only references actually needed by the model. Register any separately downloaded official file as an additional source.

## Required mapping evidence

Each reference needs source/version, licence, valid-from/to dates, key uniqueness, allowed values, business meaning, owner and transformation use. For each crosswalk record source key, target key, relationship cardinality, rationale and treatment of unmapped or changed entities. Quantify 100% of unmatched keys; do not silently drop them or infer a mapping from similar names.

Avoid multiplying facts when a reference is many-to-many. Keep parent totals distinct from child categories. Non-official analyst-created groupings must be labelled as project assumptions and sensitivity-tested where they affect the investigation shortlist.

## Domain constraints

- Aggregate published statistics cannot identify individual pupils or establish why they are absent.
- Do not join national characteristic rates onto local authorities as if locally measured.
- Preserve suppression markers and pandemic/reporting discontinuities; do not convert suppressed cells to zero.

The domain specialist approves category meaning and comparability. The Data Engineer supplies uniqueness, join-cardinality and coverage checks before the reference enters the curated model.
