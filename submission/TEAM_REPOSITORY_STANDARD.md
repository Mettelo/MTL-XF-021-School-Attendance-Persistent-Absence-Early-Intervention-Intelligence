# MTL-XF-021 — Mandatory team repository standard

## Ownership and setup

Create `MTL-XF-021-<team-name>` under the **Mettelo GitHub organisation**. Add every member using their own GitHub account. The team repository contains delivery evidence; this master remains the challenge specification. Record the master URL and reviewed specification commit in your README.

## Required structure

```

Use the implementation folders relevant to your chosen free toolchain; explain unused folders. SQL and notebooks are alternatives where appropriate, not a requirement to duplicate logic. Record dependencies and setup versions. Supply accessible BI exports if interactive access is unavailable.

## Project README requirements

State Which local-authority and school-phase combinations warrant attendance-support investigation first, and which pupil-group disparities require a separate policy review? Include team/roles, frozen cohort, analytical grain, setup/run instructions, key outputs, five findings, shortlist/scenario links, limitations, quality/UAT status and submission version.

## Collaboration and roles

| Accountable role | Project responsibility and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Business Analyst / Delivery Lead | Own the commissioned decision for Confidential Regional Education & Attendance Directorate; record at least eight prioritised requirements, each linked to a deliverable and test; maintain weekly scope and decision logs. |
| Data Governance Analyst | Register every 021 input and critical field; approve the frozen cohort, licence evidence, glossary and 100% headline-KPI lineage before analysis. |
| Data Engineer | Implement the stated 021 analytical grain, ingestion and exclusions; deliver a clean rerun with row-count/checksum evidence and no unexplained key duplicates. |
| BI Developer | Build executive, diagnostic and quality views for the commissioned decision; reconcile at least five 021 dashboard measures and test every visible filter. |
| Education / Attendance Analyst | Own phase and reporting-window comparability; review all seven KPI definitions and the three-period persistence results. |
| Policy & Early Intervention Analyst | Write the up-to-ten-area investigation plan, naming support options, evidence gaps and a review owner for each. |
| Education Assurance Analyst | Independently reconcile five source measures and execute the four attendance-specific edge cases. |

Use issues for requirements/work packages, meaningful commits, branches, PRs and reviews where practical. A single bulk upload by one member is not sufficient collaboration evidence. `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` must link each member's artefacts, authored work, reviews, issues/PRs/commits and presentation/handover contribution. Commit totals alone do not establish contribution.

## Evidence rules

D1–D12 and AC1–AC12 need direct artefact/test links. Store outputs separately from raw inputs and preserve a manifest. Do not claim a freeze without actual checksums and source validation. Keep every manual adjustment in code or an auditable transformation record. Never commit credentials, prohibited personal data or confidential materials.

## Domain review requirements

- Aggregate published statistics cannot identify individual pupils or establish why they are absent.
- Do not join national characteristic rates onto local authorities as if locally measured.
- Preserve suppression markers and pandemic/reporting discontinuities; do not convert suppressed cells to zero.

Include the four mandatory domain tests and at least six additional meaningful scenarios. A second member must verify the core rerun and five headline BI measures. Record any unavailable metric or approved scope change visibly.
