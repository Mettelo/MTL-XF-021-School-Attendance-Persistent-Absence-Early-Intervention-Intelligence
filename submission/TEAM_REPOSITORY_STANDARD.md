# MTL-XF-021 — Team repository standard

## Ownership

Create `MTL-XF-021-<team-name>` under **Mettelo** and add every member through an individual GitHub account. Record this master URL, reviewed specification commit and final submission commit/tag. The master defines scope; the team repository contains delivery evidence.

## Required areas

```

Use implementation folders appropriate to the free toolchain; SQL/notebooks need not duplicate logic. Explain unused areas. Provide environment/dependency versions and a reviewable static dashboard export where interactive access is unavailable.

## Project README and evidence

State the decision, **Director of Education & Inclusion** as the simulated decision owner, approved cohort, core/extension status, run steps, five findings, scenario/shortlist links, limitations, UAT and independent rerun results. Link each D/AC/DT item to its actual artefact, owner, reviewer and state.

Responsibilities are defined once in [the project brief](../project/PROJECT_BRIEF.md). Assign named team owners and review partners. Use issues, meaningful commits, branches, PRs and reviews where practical. One member's bulk upload is insufficient evidence of multidisciplinary contribution. `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` links authored work, reviews and presentation/handover contribution for every member; commit count alone is insufficient.

## Project-specific acceptance

1. A single row for every eligible LA/phase has a three-period persistence outcome and an explicit coverage reason.
2. Every locally stated FSM/SEN gap cites matching period, phase, geography and comparator.
3. Every proposed support investigation names the Attendance or Inclusion Lead and evidence needed before contacting schools.

Keep actual source support and mandatory blockers visible. Preserve raw/curated separation, manifests and every manual adjustment in code or an auditable record. Never commit credentials, prohibited personal information or invented approvals. Retain the simulated-client declaration in public descriptions.
