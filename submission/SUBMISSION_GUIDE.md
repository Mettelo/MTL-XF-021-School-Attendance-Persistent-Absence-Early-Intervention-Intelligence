# MTL-XF-021 — Submission guide

## What to submit

Submit the Mettelo organisation team repository URL, final commit/tag, completed `submission/FINAL_SUBMISSION.md`, and links to D1–D12. Use the provided [template](FINAL_SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md). The final version must remain reproducible after review; record changes made after submission.

## Before submitting

1. Confirm the repository README states the simulated engagement and commissioned decision: Which local-authority and school-phase combinations warrant attendance-support investigation first, and which pupil-group disparities require a separate policy review?
2. Complete the source manifest and cohort sign-off. Use both agreed DfE CSVs. Retain the published 2016/17–2025/26 coverage, then compare only matching reporting windows, school phases and geographic levels. Lock the actual release and available periods after inspecting metadata; a partial academic year must never be labelled a full year.
3. Link the requirements matrix, model, field lineage, quality/reconciliation evidence and all 7 metric definitions.
4. Link at least five findings and the up-to-ten-case investigation shortlist, including owners, evidence gaps and two compared scenarios.
5. Reconcile at least five headline dashboard measures and test all visible filters; provide a free review path and static export.
6. Execute ten or more UAT scenarios, including all domain cases below. Resolve critical/high defects and disclose any accepted remaining limitations.
7. Have another member reproduce the core outputs using documented steps; retain the run environment, checks and results.
8. Complete contribution evidence for each member and prepare the two-page briefing and 15–20 minute presentation.

## Required domain checks

1. Reproduce five published attendance measures across at least two phases and two comparable periods.
2. Show that a partial-year record is excluded from a full-year comparison.
3. Show that national characteristic rows cannot multiply local-authority counts in a join.
4. Demonstrate that a suppressed cell remains unavailable in the dashboard and shortlist.

## Panel presentation

Explain the decision, actual cohort and limitations; demonstrate one source-to-KPI-to-dashboard chain; present five findings; compare two prioritisation scenarios; justify the investigation cases; show one case where action is not supported; describe next evidence-gathering steps and named role ownership.

Expect challenges on definitions, denominators, exclusions, comparability, threshold choices, sensitivity, reproducibility and contribution. Label feedback and approvals as simulated where appropriate. Do not invent contact with real stakeholders.

## Acceptance and changes

Use [AC1–AC12](../project/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) to record pass/fail, evidence and reviewer. An unavailable conditional analysis needs a supported explanation and alternative; it cannot be disguised as a result. Source changes require registration, impact review and rerun. Final acceptance is recorded by the simulated Mettelo review panel, not self-certified as a real-client outcome.
